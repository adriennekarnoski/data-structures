# Data Structures & Algorithms

**Introduction**

The following data structures and algorithms are solved using Python by [myself](https://github.com/adriennekarnoski) 
and [Cody Dibble](https://github.com/hcodydibble).

## Getting Started

This repository has two directories inside, **data_structures** and **sorting_algorithms**.
Both directories include a README file that describe each structure or
algorithm inside that directory. The **data_structures** directory have test files
for each structure, whereas the **sorting_algorithms** directory has a single
test file that covers all algorithms.

You can install this package, where you will be able to run, test, and improve the code
or view everything right here on GitHub.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

`$ git clone https://github.com/adriennekarnoski/data-structures`

Move into the **data-structures** directory:

`$ cd data-structures`

Start your virtual environment:

`$ python3 -m venv ENV`

`$ source bin/ENV/activate`

Install package

`$ (ENV) pip install -e .`
