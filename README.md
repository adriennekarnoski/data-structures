Code 401: Python Data Structures

## Linked List
Consists of Nodes, each of which contains some data and a pointer to the next node.
### Time Complexity
* push()
    O(1)
* pop()
    O(1)
* size()
    O(1)
* search()
    O(N)
* remove()
    O(N)
* display()
    O(N)


## Stack
Data structure where elements are inserted into and removed from the head of the container.
### Time Complexity
* push()
    O(1)
* pop()
    O(1)
* len()
    O(1)


## Doubly Linked List
Consists of Nodes, each of which contains some data and pointers to the next and previous nodes.
### Time Complexity
* push()
    O(1)
* append()
    O(1)
* pop()
    O(1)
* shift()
    O(1)
* display()
    O(N)
* size()
    O(1)



## Queue
Data structure that inserts elements at the tail and accesses/removes elements at the head.
### Time Complexity
* enqueue()
    O(1)
* dequeue()
    O(1)
* peek()
    O(1)
* size()
    O(1)



## Deque
A Queue data structure that works at both ends.
Data can be inserted at the head or tail, and retrieved from the head or the tail.
### Time Complexity
* append()
    O(1)
* appendleft()
    O(1)
* pop()
    O(1)
* popleft()
    O(1)
* peek()
    O(1)
* peekleft()
    O(1)
* size()
    O(1)
